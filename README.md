# Superhero Database Program
Welcome to the Superhero Database Program, a robust and user-friendly application designed for superhero enthusiasts. This platform empowers users to create personalized accounts secured through Firebase authentication, ensuring a safe and seamless experience. Once registered, users gain access to an extensive superhero database, enriched with the ability to perform soft searches for heroes, making it easier to find their favorite characters.

One of the standout features of our program is the capability to curate custom lists of superheroes. Users can create, manage, and customize these lists, deciding whether to keep them private for personal use or share them with the community. MongoDB handles the storage and retrieval of these lists, ensuring scalability and reliability.

Administrators wield powerful control over the system, with the ability to disable or enable user accounts, maintaining a secure and well-moderated environment. Admins also have the authority to grant or revoke admin permissions, shaping the governance of the platform. This superhero database program is a comprehensive solution for both casual users and administrators alike, fostering a dynamic and engaging community of superhero enthusiasts.
